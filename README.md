### Story 

          Imagine, a peaceful friendly world, full of shapes and beautiful scenery. This is our world, this is Mumbi. We lived here peacefully until "they" came... Out of nowhere, on one of the most beautiful nights, smoke and fire filled the skies as they fell. The began infecting and morphing the innocent shapes into violent and evil creatures. Mumbi was being taken over. Some seemed immune to their techno-organic infection, while others seemed to be immune. The Immune fought back as long as they could but eventually were defeated by this seemingly indestructible threat. 
          
          The war waged for years, the Immune learned the ways of the weapon, explosive, destructive. They became shapes of war. Violent and aggressive, the very thing they spent millenia trying to overcome. Now, forced into a small corner of our world, our numbers are slim. It's now or never, our last push to take back our land. Save who you can, kill what you can, and save your planet!
