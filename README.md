# CombatCubes!

## 2D Combat featuring simple shapes, modern weaponry, and lots of ACTION! 

### Story 

Imagine, a peaceful friendly world, full of shapes and beautiful scenery. This is our world, this is Mumbi. We lived here peacefully until "they" came... Out of nowhere, on one of the most beautiful nights, smoke and fire filled the skies as they fell. They began infecting and morphing the innocent shapes into violent and evil creatures. Mumbi was being taken over. Some seemed immune to their techno-organic infection, while others seemed to be immune. The Immune fought back as long as they could but eventually were defeated by this seemingly indestructible threat. 
          
The war waged for years, the Immune learned the ways of the weapon, explosive, destructive. They became shapes of war. Violent and aggressive, the very thing they spent millenia trying to overcome. Now, forced into a small corner of our world, our numbers are slim. It's now or never, our last push to take back our land. Save who you can, kill what you can, and save your planet! 


### Gameplay Introduction

You start the game as one of the Immune, a survivor who's been seperated from your small group of survivors. With not many of you left, and your group under attack, you need to learn how to use weapons and kill the enemy. You'll learn the basic controls, obtain a basic weak weapon, and unleash hell on some enemies. After your brief introduction to the base gameplay you'll meet some friends and gain your backpack (inventory system) and your adventure will begin!
