# CombatCubes!

## 2D Combat featuring simple shapes, modern weaponry, and lots of ACTION! 

### Story 

Imagine, a peaceful friendly world, full of shapes and beautiful scenery. This is our world, this is Mumbi. We lived here peacefully until "they" came... Out of nowhere, on one of the most beautiful nights, smoke and fire filled the skies as they fell. They began infecting and morphing the innocent shapes into violent and evil creatures. Mumbi was being taken over. Some seemed immune to their techno-organic infection, while others seemed to be immune. The Immune fought back as long as they could but eventually were defeated by this seemingly indestructible threat. 
          
The war waged for years, the Immune learned the ways of the weapon, explosive, destructive. They became shapes of war. Violent and aggressive, the very thing they spent millenia trying to overcome. Now, forced into a small corner of our world, our numbers are slim. It's now or never, our last push to take back our land. Save who you can, kill what you can, and save your planet! 


### Gameplay Introduction

You start the game as one of the Immune, a survivor who's been seperated from your small group of survivors. With not many of you left, and your group under attack, you need to learn how to use weapons and kill the enemy. You'll learn the basic controls, obtain a basic weak weapon, and unleash hell on some enemies. After your brief introduction to the base gameplay you'll meet some friends and gain your backpack (inventory system) and your adventure will begin!

### General Gameplay Concept

You will progress through the different areas and zones defeating enemies and bosses, gathering new weapons and tools along the way. You'll have to solve puzzles and gather important items. You'll meet different shapes, make friends, and make some difficult descisions and hopefully with skill, explosions, and a little luck you'll be able to rid your world of the cybernetic threat and bring peace back to Mumbi. 

## Mechanics

### Character Stuff

The playable characters will all have the ability to double jump, fire weapons, and use tools. Aiming of weapons is simple, your weapon will automatically aim at the location of your mouse cursor. Your character will move through the x and y axis of your screen while also having the ability to move faster over flat terrain while jumping repeatedly. 

Your characters abilities and available actions will depend on the gear that you have equipped. For normal guns, you'll retain the ability to move left, right, double jump, and speed jump. Some items and weapons will prevent certain actions, each item will explain any negative effects it has on your character when you equip said item. For instance, the MiniGun prevents you from being able to double jump, or speed jump. 

The character can pickup items found on the ground, smash open crates to find random gear. The character will also be able to find special items and equipment that can be used for a limited time, such as the MiniGun and JetPack. 

### Enemy Stuff

A lot of the enemies encountered in the game will be cybernetic in nature and will be indicated that they are not good by a shining red light somewhere on the enemy. Some enemies will be immune to all damage other than a small weakspot. Most enemies can be killed by simple gunfire and explosives. Stationary enemies and hazards are all over the place. From missile turrets, to spike traps.

Fully cybernetic enemies have a chance to drop loot when killed, and all bosses will drop something good. Traps cannot be damaged or destroyed in any way.
