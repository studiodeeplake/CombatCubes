# CombatCubes!

## 2D Combat featuring simple shapes, modern weaponry, and lots of ACTION! 

### Story in a nutshell

Imagine, a peaceful friendly world, full of shapes and beautiful scenery. This is our world, this is Mumbi. The shapes lived here peacefully until "they" came... Out of nowhere, on one of the most beautiful nights, smoke and fire filled the skies as they appeared. Crawling out of the mountains and up from the ground. Some fell right out of the sky. They began infecting and morphing the innocent shapes into violent and evil creatures. Mumbi was being taken over. Some seemed immune to their techno-organic infection, and were brutally slaughtered. While others seemed to be completely compromised. The Immune fought back as long as they could but eventually were defeated by this seemingly indestructible threat. 
          
Some of the smartest shapes were able to capture and contain a peice of this virus, and learned its properties, and how to control it, for the most part. As a last didtch effort to fight back this infection they tried to use the virus against itself. Out of the samples they had, and with a little bit of their own tech and ingenuity, they created you, a simple cube, infused with an alien techno organic material, fully resistant to the effects of this threat. As such you have a certain level of control over this organic material. With these new powers you're able to create and construct weapons and items as you need. It's up to you to use your new powers to save this world! 


### Gameplay Introduction / Tutorial

You start the game inside a test tube where you were created. Formed out of the lifeless body of one of the fallen, and infused with the techno-organic virus you're told of your basic capabilities. You seem to be more robot or cyborg than shape, and speaking of there's not many shapes left. You'll be asked to choose your class or specialization. Then the cave that you're in comes under attack and you'll be forced to use your new capabilities to eliminate the threat. From this first conflict you'll learn the basic controls, and aspects of combat. You'll learn the basics of the user interface and how to use certain items / attachments. 

### General Gameplay Concept

From the main "hub" area, the cave, you'll gear up and venture out into the different areas of the planet, Mumbi, eliminating the portals that are spawning enemies. Similar to the older Megaman games, you'll go to different zones and fight different types of enemies and in order to defeat or "liberate" that zone, you'll need to destroy the portal. 

The main portion or "story mode" of the game is about destroying these portals. There will also be an "free travel" aspect, where the player can explore an expansive open world esque environment, with different biomes, allowing the player to farm for certain materials, items, and XP that they may need. 

## Mechanics

### Character Stuff

The playable characters will all have the ability to jump, double jump, fire a weapon, and use tools. Aiming of weapons is simple, your weapon will automatically aim at the location of your mouse cursor. Your character will move through the x and y axis of your screen while also having the ability to move faster over flat terrain while jumping repeatedly. 

The player has a choice between 3 different classes: 

| Class | Description | Main Weapon |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
|Brute|High health, high damage, likes heavy weapons! "If they get close, they get dead" |Shotgun|
|Ninja|Long range, high mobility, low health. That about sums it up.|Sniper|
|Dummy|Numb to their surroundings, the Dummy has a tendency to ignore a lot of damage, as well as dishing out suprising amounts. |Shotgun|
|Nerd|Creative and witty, the nerd can craft nearly anything. Not as mobile as the Ninja, not as strong as the Brute, but deceptively effective in combat. |Assault Rifle|

Each class will offer something different to gameplay style. The Brute is a tank, hard to kill with very high damage output, but short range and limited mobility. The Ninja is the opposite, great range and mobility, but is pretty squishy, not being able to take many hits. The Nerd class is pretty well rounded, not particularly weak in any one area, but not exceptional in any either. The Dummy is something... special... Sometimes completely ignores damage and likes to get close to things. 

Every class has two uniguqe active abilities, you'll just have to play around and discover what they do on your own. 

### Enemy Stuff

A lot of the enemies encountered in the game will be cybernetic in nature and will be indicated that they are not good by a shining red light somewhere on the enemy. Some enemies will be immune to all damage other than a small weakspot. Most enemies can be killed by simple gunfire and explosives. Stationary enemies and hazards are all over the place. From missile turrets, to spike traps.

Fully cybernetic enemies have a chance to drop loot when killed, and all bosses will drop something good. Traps cannot be damaged or destroyed in any way.
